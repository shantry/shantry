  <h1>I love tickling men.</h1>
  <p>Dear friends,

I hope this letter finds you well. I have something that I just can't keep inside any longer. I have an irrestible urge to tickle men at all hours of the day. I know it might sound strange, but it's just something I can't help.

Every time I see a man, I feel the urge to reach out and tickle them. It doesn't matter if they are a stranger or a close friend, I just can't resist. Sometimes I feel like a <strong><i>mischievous imp</i></strong>, always on the lookout for my next tickling victim.

I know it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me, it brings so much joy and laughter. I can't help but smile when I see someone's face light up with surprise and laughter after I tickle them. It's like I'm spreading happiness wherever I go.

I just wanted to share my little quirk with you all. I hope it brings a smile to your face and maybe even inspires you to find your own joy in life.<br><br>

Yours truly,<br><br>

the tickler of men.</p>

  <h1>Its been three minutes.</h1>
  <p>Dear friends,

Hello again. It's been three minutes since I last tickled a man and I am starting to go crazy. My urge to tickle men is increasing by the millisecond and it's becoming unbearable.

I never thought I would be writing a letter like this, but my obsession with tickling men has reached a whole new level. I feel like I am on the edge of madness, constantly searching for my next tickling victim.

I've tried everything to suppress my urge, but nothing seems to work. I've even tried counting backwards from 100, but all it does is make me think of all the hundreds of men I could be tickling in that time.

I know it's not normal, but I can't help how I feel. I just want to spread happiness and laughter wherever I go, and tickling men is the only way I know how to do that.<br><br>


<strong><i>Please help me.</i></strong><br><br>

Yours truly,<br><br>

The man tickler.</p>

  <h1>Strange Encounter.</h1>
  <p>Dear friends, Hello, for the third time. I had a quite peculuar encounter today. I was going along my way, feeding my <strong>neverending</strong>, crippling man tickling addiction by tickling any man i saw, when I came across this strange man. I did the normal routine, approaching him, and then reaching out to tickle him. during that time he shoved me to the ground for whatever reason, telling me all this stuff like "get the fuck away from me.", and "fucking retard", as he walked off. I, personally have no idea what any of that means, some people today are just crazy you know? Anyways I continued my day after that strange encounter, still tickling every man I saw.<br><br> <i>I am accepting applications for tickling sessions that could possibly be up to 7 hours in length, I dont plan to have any payment for anyone who participates in these.</i><br><br>Yours truly,<br><br>The tickler of males</p>
