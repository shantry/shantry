<h1>Info</h1>
<p><strong>Whats the problem with these sites woring like this?</strong> If a site works just fine after just ripping the source code from what is publicly available (ex. pressing the ctrl+u shortcut, opening the page source) then it is a very large security risk. People with malicious intentions could easily make a mockup site of their own, allowing scams to happen.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How could this be prevented?</strong> Below are two examples of html code:</p>
<br><br>
<img src="/img/good.png" alt="Image couldn't load">
<img src="/img/bad.png" alt="Image couldn't load">
<br><br>
<p id="info">The image on the left is an example of how the code for a site <strong>should</strong> be formatted. The image on the right is an example of how the code for a site <strong>should not</strong> be formatted. When code is formatted to use actual links (ex. example.com) to link to resources such as: images, Javascript, or css, it takes out all the work needed for a person to accurately copy a site. While it still is technically possible for a person to copy a site when it uses the good format, it takes more time. A way to combat any ripping is to split the css up into its separate parts based on what it does to change the site. Too many large websites use the bad way to format their sites. I started making this site as a joke after finding out that Walmart worked, so I tried others. This site will update as more working sites are found.</p>
